            <h1>Recipes-World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h1>
        </article>
        <p>I adapted this receipe from a book called Sydney food by Bill Grainger. Evan since testing these eggs on my 1st visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross, Sydney. I have
            been after the recipe. I have since transformed it into what I really believe are the best scrambled eggs I have ever tested.</p>

            <p>This receipes is what I call a "very special breakfast": just look at the ingredients to see why it has to be tested to be believed.</p>

            <h1>ingredients</h1>

            <p>The following ingredients makes one serving:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>2 eggs</li>

              <li>1/3 cup of cream(23/4 fl ounces)</li>

              <li>3 fresh chives(chopped)</li>
            </ul>

                <li>using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the centre as if it were an omelet, and let it cook for another 20 seconds.</li>
